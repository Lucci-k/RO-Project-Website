            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
            We are a group of outdoor enthusiasts with a shared passion for seeking
            the furthest limits that nature has to offer. No day is a good day if we can
            not spend it outdoors with our friends. From hiking to rock climbing, we commit 
            to it all. Our mision is to spread the secrets of our adventures to as many people
                that we can. <strong> That is who we are.</strong>

                <p>
                    The purose behind this website was to promote my "uncle's" business and 
                    allow customers another choice to purchase services online. The steps I 
                    took to reach the goal of the website involved the planning phases in the 
                    previous milestones. First, I developed the purpose of the web site including
                    specific desired results and determining the targeted audince. Next, I built the 
                    structure of the site and mapped the navigation of the pages. Then I determined
                    site aesthetics including page design, color choices, and typography choices.
                    The final step was coding the website.

                <h1>Defense of the final Project</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My website contains the index, products, contact, rentals, and about us pages. 
                    All of these pages contains similar design features to support eachother. For example,
                    each page has the same banner, navigation bar, and footer. The only thing to change
                    between the pages is the content of the page. This gives a familiarity to the user between 
                    each page. The color tones depicts an outdoor atmosphere to complement the theme of the 
                    website. The typography I choose was to make the site appear modern, but still be easy to read.

                <p>
                    The is a lot of potential for this site. The main problem with this site is that it is 
                    completely static. It would be nice to add Javascript to the site to allow the site greater 
                    features. For example it would be nice to add a shopping cart feature and allow custumer to 
                    purchase goods of the site.
